Practices to develop code that's easier to understand, extend, and maintain throughout a project and beyond, from _Practices of an Agile Developer_. 

### Program intently and expressively

Code you write must clearly communicate your intent and must be expressive. By doing so, your code will be readable and understandable. Because your code isn't confusing, you'll also avoid potential errors, for you or other readres.

Use method names that convey intent, and name method paramteters to help readers understand their purpose. Express your intentions clearly to the reader of the code.

Always choose readability over convenience.

### Code in increments

Code in short edit/build/test cycles to create code that's clearer, simpler, and easier to maintain. This allows you to get ongoing feedback, and prevent you from getting code that becomes too complicated or messy. 

You want to constantly evaluate how the code is shaping up, making many small adjustments rather than few really, really large ones. 

### Communicate in your code

Documentation is tedious, but necessary. Document your code by writing clear code, and by using comments to express noncode issues. 

A few lines of comments that describe the behavior of the method can save you a lot of effort. 

Good variable names, use of whitespace, separation of logic, and concise expression all serve to make your code more clear. 

### Actively evaluate tradeoffs

Consider performance, convenience, prdouctivity, cost, and time to market. If performance is adequate, then focus on improving other factors. Don't complicate design for the sake of perceived performance and elegance. 

### Keep it simple

Develop the simplest solution that works -- incorporate patterns, principles, and technology only if you have a compelling reason to use them. 

### Write cohesive code 

Keep classes focused and components small. Avoid the temptation to build large classes or components or miscellaneous catchall classes.
